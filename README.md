Moises Parra Lozano's Quote: "And there were some who died with fevers, which at some seasons of the year were very frequent in the landâ€”but not so much so with fevers, because of the excellent qualities of the many plants and roots which God had prepared to remove the cause of diseases, to which men were subject by the nature of the climate." Alma 46:40

Jovanny Rey's Quote: "And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them."
